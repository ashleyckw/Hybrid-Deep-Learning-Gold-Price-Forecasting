# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Gold-Price-Forecasting
This project presents a time series analysis-driven hybrid deep learning approach for gold price forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) integration. The proposed model incorporates historical gold price data, macroeconomic indicators, and market trends, utilizing hybrid models such as LSTM-CNN, BiLSTM-CNN, and LSTM-GRU.

## About The Project
Gold is a vital commodity in financial markets, and accurate price forecasting can significantly impact investment decisions. This project integrates historical gold prices and macroeconomic data into a hybrid forecasting model using LSTM, LSTM-CNN, BiLSTM-CNN, and LSTM-GRU algorithms. The goal is to enhance predictive performance and provide valuable insights for stakeholders like investors, central banks, and mining companies.

## Features:
Hybrid deep learning models: LSTM, LSTM-CNN, BiLSTM-CNN, and LSTM-GRU
Time series analysis with gold price data and economic indicators
Hyperparameter tuning and optimization for improved model accuracy
Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning techniques
Predictive performance evaluated using MAE, MAPE, RMSE, and RÂ²

## Key Models:
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* LSTM-CNN: Combines LSTM with convolutional layers to enhance feature extraction.
* BiLSTM-CNN: Bidirectional LSTM coupled with CNN for capturing sequential patterns in both directions.
* LSTM-GRU: Integrates LSTM and GRU for efficient processing of time-dependent data.
