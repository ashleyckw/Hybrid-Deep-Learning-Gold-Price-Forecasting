# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Gold-Price-Forecasting
This project presents a time series analysis-driven hybrid deep learning approach for gold price forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) integration. The proposed model incorporates historical gold price data, macroeconomic indicators, and market trends, utilizing hybrid models such as LSTM-CNN, BiLSTM-CNN, and LSTM-GRU.
